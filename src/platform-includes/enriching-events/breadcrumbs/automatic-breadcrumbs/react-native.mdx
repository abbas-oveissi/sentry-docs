The React Native SDK already captures breadcrumbs automatically via the Native SDKs for Android and iOS.

- [Automatic Breadcrumbs for Android](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
- [Automatic Breadcrumbs for iOS](/platforms/apple/configuration/integrations/default/#sentryautobreadcrumbtrackingintegration)

- For interaction breadcrumbs wrapp your `App` using the [`Sentry.wrap`](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#wrap-your-root-component) method.

- For navigation breadcrumbs use one of the [SDK's natigation integrations](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#enable-routing-instrumentation).

- `HTTP` requests are included in breadcrumbs by default.

- To track redux actions and latest store state use [`Sentry.createReduxEnhancer`](platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/redux).
